# Flatter

Flatter is a GitHub Action for building and hosting a Flatpak repository in a
static hosting environment, such as GitHub Pages.

## Example

```yml
name: Flatter

on:
  # Rebuild once a day
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  flatter:
    name: Flatter
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ghcr.io/andyholmes/flatter/gnome:43
      options: --privileged

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # See "GPG Signing" below
      - name: Setup GPG
        id: gpg
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg@v5
        with:
          gpg_private_key: ${{ secrets.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          passphrase: ${{ secrets.GPG_PASSPHRASE }}

      - name: Build
        uses: andyholmes/actions/flatter@main
        with:
          files: |
            com.example.App.json
          gpg-sign: ${{ steps.gpg.outputs.fingerprint }}
          upload-pages-artifact: true
          upload-flatpak-bundle: true
```

## Inputs

The only required input is `files`, which should be a list of paths to Flatpak
manifests (JSON or YAML) to build. Typically one or both of
`upload-pages-artifact` and `upload-flatpak-bundle` will be set to `true`,
depending on the deployment style.

| Name                    | Default | Description                              |
|-------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| `files`                 | None    | A list of files to build                 |
| `cache-key`             | None    | A cache key                              |
| `upload-flatpak-bundle` | `false` | Upload each application as a Flatpak     |
| `upload-pages-artifact` | `false` | Upload the repo for GitHub Pages         |

There are also inputs that correspond to command-line options for `flatpak` and
`flatpak-builder`, most commonly used:

| Name                    | Default  | Description                             |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `arch`                  | `x86_64` | The architecture to build for           |
| `gpg-sign`              | None     | A GPG Key fingerprint                   |
| `repo`                  | `repo`   | The repository directory                |

See [`action.yml`](action.yml) for a full list of inputs.


## GPG Signing

Flatter supports signing the repository and bundles with GPG. First generate a
GPG key for your repository:

```sh
mkdir flatter
gpg2 --homedir flatter --quick-gen-key username@github.io
```

Export the private key, then add the key and passphrase as GitHub Action secrets
(e.g. `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` and `GPG_PASSPHRASE`):

```sh
gpg2 --homedir flatter --armor --export-secret-key username@github.io
```

[crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg][gpg-action] can be used to easily import and
preset the passphrase for signing:

```yml
name: Flatter (Signed)

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  flatter:
    name: Flatter
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ghcr.io/andyholmes/flatter/gnome:43
      options: --privileged

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup GPG
        id: gpg
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg@v5
        with:
          gpg_private_key: ${{ secrets.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          passphrase: ${{ secrets.GPG_PASSPHRASE }}

      - name: Build
        uses: andyholmes/actions/flatter@main
        with:
          files: |
            com.example.App.json
          gpg-sign: ${{ steps.gpg.outputs.fingerprint }}
```

## Deploying Flatter

Flatpak repositories generated by `flatpak-builder` are deployable as static
assets, so there are a number of choices for deploying Flatter.

### Custom Deploy

The Flatpak repository directory can also be deployed with a custom method, such
as [JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action][deploy-action]:

```yml
name: Flatter (Deploy)

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  flatter:
    name: Flatter
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ghcr.io/andyholmes/flatter/gnome:43
      options: --privileged

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build
        uses: andyholmes/actions/flatter@main
        with:
          files: |
            com.example.App.json
          repo: repo

      - name: Deploy Repository
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v4
        with:
          folder: repo
          target-folder: flatpak
```
